# familyClassifier

Family classifier was a simple application made with Apple's coreML library. Training data consisted of 10 images of each 
my family members including the dog. The application has a simple GUI which asks for a picture to be taken or uploaded. The app
would then tell you with a statistical degree of confidence which member of the family was in the picture. The app does not 
work as well as I hoped it would. The nature of Apples machine learning library is such that more details were taken from the 
background than the individuals face. Of all my family members, the dog is recognized with the most confidence.
